# Clear for Reddit

Clear is an open-sourced, cross-platform mobile application for browsing reddit.

So far, Clear is mostly contained to mass browsing, but features will be added as time goes on.

(screenshots have large head and footer due to them being taken on the pixel 5, which has no bezel. The app detects if a bezel is present and changes the header and footer size accordingly) 

## Setup

In order to run Clear yourself, you'll need to set it up like any other react-native application.

### Android

Simply run `npm install` in the root directory

### iOS

run `npm install` in the root directory, then run `pod install` in the `ios` directory

### Creating a Reddit Application

For communicating with the reddit API, you'll need to create an application in your reddit account's preferences. [Here's](https://redditclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth/) a link to doing so.

Once you have your apps userAgent, clientID, and refreshToken (helper [here](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper) for retrieving that), put them each in a file within `util/snoowrap` titled `snoowrapConfig.tsx`. It should look like:

```ts
type Config = {
  userAgent: string;
  clientId: string;
  refreshToken: string;
};

const snoowrapConfig: Config = {
  userAgent: "USERAGENT", //a unique name for your app; you create this yourself
  clientId: "CLIENTID", //your clients id, found underneath the name of your application in your reddit account's app preferences
  refreshToken: "REFRESHTOKEN", //a refreshToken for creating a default account that unauthed users will use when they use the app without an account
};

export default snoowrapConfig;
```

### Accessing imgur API

In order to get images from imgur in an album, you'll need to register for imgur api credentials. You can get those
[here](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient). Select `Anynymous usage without user authorization`. Place your
client id and client secret in `util/imgur/` in a file called `imgurConfig.tsx`. It should look like this:

```ts
const imgurConfig: any = {
  clientID: "CLIENTID",
  clientSecret: "CLIENT SECRET",
};

export default imgurConfig;
```

### Playing YouTube natively on Android

You'll need a google API key in order to play youtube videos in the app on android. You can find out how to get one [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/register). Once you have a key, place it in `util/youtube` in a file titled `youtubeConfig.tsx`. It should look like this:

```ts
export const apiKey = "AIzaSyB56c605jONMlWRn0OzTTvLy6_p00Hgro4";
```
